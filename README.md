# Project description
The project is about the 2048 game, featuring an arena comprising a 4x4 grid with 16 vacant cells. Upon initiating the gameplay by pressing the 'Start' button, two random cells are populated with numbers, predominantly 2 (90% probability) or occasionally 4 (10%). Players navigate through the grid using keyboard arrows, executing moves in the directions of top, right, bottom, or left. Numbers traverse the grid in the specified direction, amalgamating only once per move. Upon completion of each move, one vacant cell is replenished with a random number (2 or 4). The objective is victory upon reaching the number 2048 in any cell. Defeat is if further moves become impossible. This game is optimized for devices equipped with a keyboard.
